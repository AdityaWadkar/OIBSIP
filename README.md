## 1. Iris-flower-classisifcation


## üåºDownload dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv)
## üöÄ Brief Idea
The Iris dataset is a popular dataset for machine learning classification projects. It contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species - setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The goal of the project is to create a classification model that can accurately predict the species of a new iris flower based on its measurements.

In this project, I used Python and its popular machine learning libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, to perform data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling.

The project will begin with loading and exploring the dataset to gain insights into the data. Then, we I processed the data by cleaning, transforming, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

Next, I built several logistic regression classification model and evaluate  model's performance using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Finally, I used it to predict the species of new iris flowers. I also visualized the results using Matplotlib and create a user-friendly interface using Flask to deploy the model.

Overall, this project will provide a step-by-step guide on how to build a machine learning classification model using the Iris dataset, which is suitable for beginners and intermediate level machine learning enthusiasts.

## 3. car price prediction for beginners


## üåºDownload dataset from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/CarPrice.csv)
## üöÄ Brief Idea
The goal of a car price prediction project is to use machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data on car prices and make predictions about future prices. This involves collecting large amounts of data on different car models, their features, and their prices over time.

Once the data has been collected and organized, the next step is to choose an appropriate machine learning model and train it on the data. This involves feeding the model the historical data on car prices, allowing it to learn the patterns and relationships between the different features and their impact on the price.

After the model has been trained, it can then be used to predict future car prices based on new data inputs. For example, if a new car model is released, the model can analyze its features and predict its price based on the historical data.

Overall, a car price prediction project can be a valuable tool for consumers, car dealerships, and manufacturers to better understand and anticipate changes in the automotive market.
